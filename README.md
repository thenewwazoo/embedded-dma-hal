# embedded-dma-hal

This crate is a (very brief) encapulation of DMA-related traits suitable for use in a HAL. It is extracted from and based upon Jorge Aparicio's [dma work in his stmf32f103xx-hal crate](https://github.com/thenewwazoo/stm32f103xx-hal/blob/master/src/dma.rs). I include this crate as a dependency of my work on the [STM32L4x6-hal crate](https://github.com/DoumanAsh/stm32l4x6_hal), and intend to use it in device drivers as a complement to [embedded-hal](https://github.com/japaric/embedded-hal).
